# Introduction

`pathpy` is an OpenSource python package for the modeling and analysis of pathways and temporal networks
using higher-order and multi-order graphical models. 

The package is specifically tailored to analyze sequential data multiple observations of short, independent paths 
observed in a graph topology. Examples for such data include user click streams in information networks,
biological pathways, or traces of information propagation in social media. It also supports the extraction 
of pathways from data on temporal networks, such as time-stamped social interactions or contact patterns.

`pathpy` facilitates the analysis of temporal correlations in such data, using principled model selection 
techniques to infer higher-order graphical representatiosn that capture both topological and temporal 
characteristics of time-resolved relational data. It extends (and will eventually supersede) the package [`pyTempnets`](https://github.com/IngoScholtes/pyTempNets).

This methods implemented in this package have been introduced in the following research works:

The module is written in pure python, has no platform-specific dependencies and should thus work on all platforms. it builds on numpy and scipy. 

The latest development version can be installed by typing:

`> pip install git+git://github.com/IngoScholtes/pathpy.git`

## Tutorial

`pathpy` is the successor of `pyTempNets`. A detailed educational tutorial illustrating its theoretical foundation is [available online](https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/people/ischoltes/research-insights/temporal-networks-demo/).
